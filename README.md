# Google CLI

A simple and minimalist command line interface for executing everyday google searches.

# Installation
Download the goog file via curl and output it into a directory in your PATH (in my case ~/bin)
`curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joeysnclr/google-cli/master/goog" --output ~/bin/goog`

Use chmod to make the goog file executable
`chmod +x ~/bin/goog`

# Usage
Simply type `goog` then anything you would like to search for.
Example:
`goog how to reverse a linked list`
